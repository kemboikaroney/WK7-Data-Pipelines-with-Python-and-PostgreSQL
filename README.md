# Predicting Equipment Failure and Scheduling Maintenance Proactively

## Project Deliverable
‚óè A GitHub repository with a python file (.py) with your solution.

## Problem Statement
Equipment failure is a major cause of downtime in the telecommunications industry, which can
result in significant financial losses and customer dissatisfaction. To minimize downtime and
ensure optimal performance, it is crucial to identify potential equipment failures and schedule
maintenance accordingly proactively. This requires the collection and analysis of large amounts
of data generated by various equipment and network sensors.
The deliverable for this project is a data pipeline that can efficiently collect, clean, and analyze
equipment and network sensor data. The pipeline should be designed to identify potential
equipment failures and schedule maintenance proactively, minimizing downtime and improving
overall equipment performance. The data pipeline will be built using Python and PostgreSQL
and with the Postgres database hosted on Google Cloud.
